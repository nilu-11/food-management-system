# Ode2Code Hackathon Project Documentation üöÄ

Welcome to the **Ode2Code** project ‚Äì a hackathon effort that leverages a modern full‚Äëstack setup to rapidly transform creative ideas into a working web application. This documentation provides an overview of the technologies used, details the directory structure, and explains the purpose of each file. 

---

## Overview ‚ú®

**Ode2Code** showcases the power of combining a server‚Äërendered frontend with a robust backend. The project uses **Next.js** (a React framework) for the user interface and **Node.js** for handling backend API requests. The goal is to deliver a smooth and performant experience while maintaining clear code organization ‚Äî perfect for rapid development during a hackathon.

## Tech Stack üõ†Ô∏è

- **Next.js:**  
  - A React framework used to create fast, SEO‚Äëfriendly pages with server‚Äëside rendering.
  - Simplifies routing (each file in the `pages/` directory automatically becomes a route) and code splitting.  

- **Node.js:**  
  - A JavaScript runtime for building scalable backend services.
  - Manages API endpoints, business logic, and server configuration.

- **Additional Libraries:**  
  - Check the `package.json` for other dependencies that power the project (middleware, styling libraries, helper utilities, etc.).

## File & Folder Breakdown üìÑ

- **README.md**  
  Contains project description, setup instructions, and documentation notes. It acts as the go‚Äëto guide for anyone who wants to understand or contribute to the project.

- **package.json**  
  Lists all dependencies (including Next.js, React, Node.js libraries, etc.) and includes scripts such as `npm run dev` for development and `npm run start` for production.

- **next.config.ts**  
  Holds custom configurations for Next.js, such as environment variables and custom webpack settings.

- **components/**  
  Contains individual UI components (e.g., navigation bars, buttons) to promote code reuse.  
  - **Header.ts & Footer.ts:** Standard components used to provide consistent site navigation and footer content across all pages.

- **public/**  
  Contains all static files that do not require processing (images, icons, fonts). Files here are served directly.

- **styles/**  
  Houses all CSS or SCSS files that provide styling rules for components and pages.

- **server/**  
  - **index.ts:** Initializes the Node.js server, sets up middleware (e.g., body parsing, CORS), and configures the port.
  - **routes/:** Defines various API endpoints which are consumed by the frontend.
